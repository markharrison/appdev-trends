## Low Code / Citizen Developer

![](images/12-lowcode.png)

Citizen developers are employees who create new business applications for consumption by others using development and runtime environments sanctioned by corporate IT. They are typically not professional developers, but instead are end users that encounter / understand business problems and use simple low code tools to create solutions.

Microsoft Power Platform provides low code tooling to facilitate the citizen developer and encourages a culture of innovation amongst the workforce which helps release untapped value.  The Platform includes:

- Power Apps
- Power Automate ( includes robotic process automation (RPA) )
- Power Virtual Agents
- Power BI

The applications developed can be used to connect to Office 365, Dynamics 365, Azure, and hundreds of other third-party applications to enable end-to-end business solutions.

Optionally, any built Power Platform applications can be incorporated into DevOps tooling to ensure anything deployed that becomes business critical can be managed, supported, and governed.
