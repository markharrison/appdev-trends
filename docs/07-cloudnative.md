![](images/07-cloudnative.png)

Its applications that provide business value – managing complex infrastructure just consumes resources / time / money with no return. 

Development teams just want to focus on shipping applications – and not be distracted managing the infrastructure stack. They want agility so they can innovate faster and to enable a shorter time to market.

The application platform needs to auto-scale based on workload demand – scale up to handle spikes / scale down afterwards to safe costs. Resiliency must be built into the platform. It must offer cloud economics – that is efficient and productive, and you pay only for what you use with no wasted resources.
