## Cross Device / Cross Platform

![](images/08-xplatform.png)

Most users have multiple devices and expect to securely access their applications on any device from any location, and at any time. They may have a PC, a tablet, and a smartphone – and expect the experience to adapt based on the display characteristics of the device and the quality of the network.

Developing for multiple platforms will add to development costs and choices must be made. Do you develop natively for each platform or use cross platform development tools (like Xamarin/MAUI)?

Modern web platforms support PWA (progress web applications) that can act like mobile apps – they can be installed, access device hardware (like the camera), can operate offline and store data on the device.  This approach is likely to become popular as it provides for maximum reach – with costs contained to the development of a single web version.

Recent advances in device technology means that development may also need to target a new range of devices. Such items include:

- Smart speakers, interactive voice units…
- Wearables, smart watches, heath monitoring devices …
- Mixed reality headsets …
- IoT Devices, sensors, control units …
- Games consoles …

Microsoft is no longer a Windows first company – we provide tools and services for all developers / all platforms – and embrace open source software.
